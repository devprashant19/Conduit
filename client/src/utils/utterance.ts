/**
 * UtteranceAssembler — join the fragments of one spoken sentence.
 *
 * A speech recogniser finalises at every pause, so "start the agent… called
 * gere" arrives as two or three separate final results. Dispatching each one
 * as it lands executed the first half of the sentence while the user was still
 * talking. Measured directly against a clip with a one-second pause in it: a
 * bare recogniser emitted three `FINAL` events for one intended command.
 *
 * So fragments are buffered and only released once the speaker has genuinely
 * stopped. The clock is injectable purely so this is testable without waiting
 * in real time.
