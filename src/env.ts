/**
 * Load configuration from `.env`.
 *
 * Plain `dotenv.config()` only looks at `path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')`,
 * which is the repo root when you run `npm run start:all` — and the *install
 * directory* when the packaged desktop app launches itself. A desktop user has
 * no repo, so every `.env` setting (BEDROCK_MODEL_ID, AWS keys, GROQ_API_KEY,
 * ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, CONDUIT_AUTH) silently fell back to its default there
 * while working fine on the web.
 *
 * So we also read `~/.conduit/.env`, which exists in both modes — Conduit
 * already owns that directory. The working directory wins where both define a
 * key, since dotenv never overwrites a variable that is already set, and a real
 * environment variable still beats both.
 *
 * Call this once, first thing, in every entry point (server, daemon).
