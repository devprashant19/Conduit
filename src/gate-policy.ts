/**
 * Who answers an approval gate — you, or Conduit on your behalf.
 *
 * The original position was that every gate is yours. In practice most gates
 * are an agent asking "shall I create README.md?", and answering those by hand
 * all day is precisely what a control centre is supposed to spare you. If you
 * have to approve everything yourself there was no point having a Keeper.
 *
 * So gates are sorted into two tiers (`classifyGate`, in gatePatterns.ts) and
 * only one of them reaches you:
 *
 *   harmful  — expensive or impossible to undo (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`,
 *              `DROP TABLE`, `kubectl delete`), or anything the Supervisor
 *              itself flagged as risky. Always yours. Never auto-approved,
 *              whatever the settings say.
 *   routine  — the CLI is waiting on an ordinary y/n prompt. Answered for you
 *              when `autoApproveRoutine` is on, which is the default.
 *
 * An auto-approval is never silent. One line goes to the project group chat
 * saying what was asked and that it was allowed, and the full gate goes to the
 * audit log — so "what did it agree to while I was away" is one screen.
 *
 * This module owns only the setting. The classification is pure and lives with
 * the patterns, where it can be tested without touching a filesystem.
