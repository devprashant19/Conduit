/**
 * Approving a gate by voice, enforced by the server.
 *
 * Conduit's rule has been that approving an agent's pending action is not
 * reachable from speech at all. That was not a flag — the action was absent
 * from the routing union, because a gate can be `rm -rf`, a force-push, or a
 * dropped database, and a transcriber that writes "approve" for "of course"
 * would have been enough to run it.
 *
 * The user has asked for approve-by-voice, with a spoken confirmation. This
 * module is what makes that request safe to grant. The important design
 * decision is that **none of it is a prompt instruction**: a model told to ask
 * for confirmation will one day decide it already has it. Instead the server
 * refuses the approval unless all four of these hold:
 *
 *   1. `describe_gate` was called for this exact gate in this session — so the
 *      command was read out loud before anyone agreed to it.
 *   2. That happened within 60 seconds. Consent goes stale.
 *   3. The user's own speech since then contains an explicit approval. The
 *      phrase is matched against the **transcript stream**, not against a tool
 *      argument, so the model cannot supply its own confirmation. Bare "yes" is
 *      not enough — "yes" is what people say to almost anything.
 *   4. The gate is still open and its text is unchanged. An agent that moved on
 *      to a different prompt is a different question.
 *
 * `reject` needs none of this. Refusing is always safe and always available.
